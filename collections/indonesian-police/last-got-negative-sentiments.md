The theft took place after she just finished withdrawing money from an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) in Pulogadung, East Jakarta. She went to the police to report of the incident, but the currently officer in charge, Aipda Rudi Panjaitan, dismissed her report right away and told her to go home.

In other news, the Chief of East Jakarta Resort Police said that Aipda Rudi Panjaitan was only "joking" and did not have intentions to reject the report ([tier 2 media: Tribunnews](https://jateng.tribunnews.com/2021/12/13/kapolres-sebut-aipda-rudi-panjaitan-hanya-bercanda-tolak-laporan-korban-perampokan)).

The police force in Indonesia was meant to serve and protect the people. What they are doing right now is the opposite.

## Blackmailing a rape victim

<!-- datetime: 2021-12-10T04:20:00.000Z -->

Two police officers were being investigated as they blackmailed a rape victim, telling her to create a "letter" so that the perpetrators would not be processed by law.

The article can be found here: https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20211210103045-12-732360/diduga-intimidasi-korban-perkosaan-2-polisi-diperiksa-propam-riau.

The victim recorded the "conversation" containing the threat. In the video, although the police officers' faces weren't clear, their voices had high intonation. The sentences they said were along the lines of, _"We have helped you and this is how you repaid us. Next time if you have more problems, don't go to our office"_.

They [one of the police officers] continued, _"Your proof was not truthy. I am concerned about you, what will you do if your child is abandoned? You have a child, right? They will be abandoned [if you go to prison and can't take care of them]. We are helping you. I still have conscience, otherwise you will be jailed. You are helped, you and your child are helped."_

The video finished with them saying, _"If you don't bring it [the letter] tomorrow, don't blame me. I will wait you at 8 o'clock tomorrow, if by 10 o'clock you haven't arrived, I will make you the perpetrator instead"_.

By the time the article was written, Riau's regional police department were investigating the 2 police officers in particular for violating the professional ethics. It was said that the investigation will go further beyond that, including the North Tambusai's sectoral police department, where the victim reported the case in the first place. Hopefully, all police officers who violated their own ethics will get disciplinary actions. I'm not expecting much, however.

This event was very baffling. How could they, instead of helping the victim, they blackmailed the victim instead? Oh, sure, "still have conscience". What a joke. They only answer to money.

## Slow response and ignorance towards rape victim's plight

<!-- datetime: 2021-12-03T12:10:00.000Z -->

A rape victim's plea was ignored by the police force. Only after the victim committed suicide and it went viral on Twitter, they went to "work".

The viral hashtag in Twitter can be seen here: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SAVENOVIAWIDYASARI&src=trend_click&vertical=trends.

Long story short, she was raped by a police officer because Randy Bagus Hari Sasongko (the perpetrator) forced her to consume a sleeping pill. The victim became pregnant. Initially, she demanded that Randy to be responsible of this, so they came up with a wedding plan. However, when she came to his parents' house to let them know about their plan, the parents didn't approve of it because Randy still had an older brother who hadn't married yet and because he was "new" in the police force. Hence, Randy told the victim to get an abortion, which she didn't want to, because by that time, she was already 4 months into pregnancy.

Randy's mother didn't support the victim, telling her that it was her own personal problems. Worse, it was said that Randy's father had some help from "mystic folks" to make some distance between Randy at her, to the extent of causing Randy to get amnesia. It was also said that there were some "weird stuff" happening around the victim's house.

All this happened, the victim tried to make a report to a local police force, but they dismissed it right away. After the victim had committed suicide and the Indonesian Twitter went viral about this, did they take action. The victim deserved a kinder fate, may she rest in peace. As for Randy, I really hope he gets the punishment he deserves. Along with his parents, too. Absolutely disgraceful human beings.
