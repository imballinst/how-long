The viral hashtag in Twitter can be seen here: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SAVENOVIAWIDYASARI&src=trend_click&vertical=trends.

Long story short, she was raped by a police member because Randy Bagus Hari Sasongko (the perpetrator) forced her to consume a sleeping pill. The victim became pregnant. Initially, she demanded that Randy to be responsible of this, so they came up with a wedding plan. However, when she came to his parents' house to let them know about their plan, the parents didn't approve of it because Randy still had an older brother who hadn't married yet and because he was "new" to the police institution. Hence, Randy told the victim to get an abortion, which she didn't want to, because by that time, she was already 4 months into pregnancy.

Randy's mother didn't support the victim, telling her that it was her own personal problems. Worse, it was said that Randy's father had some help from "mystic folks" to make some distance between Randy at her, to the extent of causing Randy to get amnesia. It was also said that there were some "weird stuff" happening around the victim's house.

All this happened, the victim tried to make a report to the police, but they dismissed it right away. Now that the victim had committed suicide and the Indonesian Twitter went viral about this did they take action. The victim deserved a kinder fate, may she rest in peace. As for Randy, I really hope he gets the punishment he deserves. Along with his parents, too. Absolutely disgraceful human beings.
