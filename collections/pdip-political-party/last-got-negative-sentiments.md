The article above also includes the CCTV video from the minimarket. It was shown that HSM drove a car which hit the FL's motorcycle. HSM then moved his car backwards a bit. A bit short after, FL asked to HSM that he moved his car a bit more, so that his motorcycle could get out from the parking area. Instead of doing exactly that, HSM started slapping FL's face. It didn't stop there, as he began kicking and punching FL until he backed down inside the minimarket's terrace. He just stood there and didn't fight back.

## Doing campaign in a disaster area

Recently, Mt. Semeru (in East Java) erupted, causing a lot of fatalities and injuries to the people living in the region near the mountain, not to mention the amount of materials buried beneath the volcanic ashes. More information about the disaster can be read in this article: https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-59552117.

Amidst the people's sadness, however, there were sightings of campaign billboard from Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan (PDIP) in numerous areas in East Java. Inside the billboard was the picture of Puan Maharani, the speaker of House of Representatives ("Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat"â€”or "DPR", in Indonesian). There was also the text, "time to rise up and face the future".

In the article above, it's quite funny that politicians from PDIP had differing opinions. One politician, Hendrawan Supratikno, said that those billboards weren't theirs because they didn't want to "showcase" their good deeds. However, another politician, Utut Adianto, said that they were products from a spontaneous politician or a volunteer.

Until at the time of writing, billboards from PDIP have resulted in generally negative sentiment from people. This was because the billboards were created in the middle of the pandemic. A lot of people thought that it was not appropriate to expand electability when people (especially those with low to middle income) were struggling.
